CookieList is a versatile Extra for MODX Revolution that stores any type of list, such as a wishlist, in a cookie.

It comes with a snippet that generates a configurable Add to / Remove from wishlist link, as well as a snippet to read the data into a comma separated list.

CookieList was originally developed by Romain Tripault of "Melting Media":http://www.melting-media.com/ to be included with the "bdListings Extra":https://github.com/Mark-H/bdListings. Since then it has been abstracted into a seperate addon, to enable others of using it for different targets as well.
